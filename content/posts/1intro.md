Hello.  This blog is being maintained as part of my master's thesis on blockchain security for John Jay's D4CS program.  I don't really intend the updates to be weekly per se, but rather it should be updated weekly at a minimum.  Entries will likely range from a few links and my comments (short or otherwise) on them, to rambles about potential security flaws in the blockchain, etc.  By request, I'll address any topics pertaining to CSCI 385.  If you happen to be a student in that class, feel free to comment on this blog, or email me if you have any questions or comments.  

Regarding commenting, please note that you needn't (and in my opinion, shouldn't) register anywhere to comment via Disqus.  It's set to enable "guest" commenting, and I'm not worried about any readers impersonating any others.  Anonymous commenting is also welcome.

To close this brief introduction, here are some useful links relative to studying the blockchain.
